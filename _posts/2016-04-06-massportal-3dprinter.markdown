We are excited to announce, that we have acquired a High Definition 3D printer for our prototyping needs. 
With Pharaoh model XD we can now print in most thermoplastic materials with one of the best available surface quality in industry.

We decided to buy a MassPortal Pharaoh XD, which if compared to conventional 3D printers, is based on the Delta robot technology. This means faster speeds with lower levels of vibration and noise — important comfort considerations if the printer is used on a daily basis. 

XD has quality linear guides to ensure smooth and precise movements, with best-of-industry print surface quality, which was an important consideration, as we are printing fine detailed objects for our prototypes.

We also considered ability to print in variuous materials, like recommended PLA (Polylactic Acid) thermoplastic and also an experimental ones - ABS, PET, PVA, HIPS and other thermoplastic.
