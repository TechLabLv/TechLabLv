<blockquote>As Carvey puts it - Carvey is a new, remarkably easy to use, tabletop 3D carving machine for turning ideas into real objects.</blockquote>
We agree! A great addition to our Equipment, Carvey CNC machine works with a variety of materials - wood, plastic, soft metals, linoleum, foam, and molding wax. Easel's material library is programmed with all the details, so we can get started right away.

Our MasPortal 3D Printer and Carvey CNC allows us to mix product prototyping with both 3Dprinted plastic and carved materials out of slabs, so we can get our work done faster and deliver more like a real-life product feeling to our prototypes.
